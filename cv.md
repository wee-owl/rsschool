### About myself  
I worked for a government organization for a long time (about 7 years), was engaged in engineering, development and implementation of SDO management systems. During this period, I have gained a lot of practical experience and a lot of important skills.  
Recently, I wanted to change my occupation and do front-end development. This is a specialist of a wide profile: layout designer, programmer, artist and engineer all rolled into one, which means a wide range of opportunities. I am currently actively studying this area in order to become a highly qualified front-end developer in the future. I enjoy studying of this area and I devote all time to this.
